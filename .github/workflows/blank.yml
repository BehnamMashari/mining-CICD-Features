# This is an enhanced workflow with Python setup, build, test, and deployment steps

name: CI/CD Pipeline

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build-and-deploy"
  build-and-deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # 2. Set up Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'  # Replace with your preferred Python version

      # 3. Install Python dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pygithub requests
      
      # 4. Build your project (Replace with your actual build commands)
      - name: Build project
        run: |
          # Replace this with your actual build commands, e.g., compiling, packaging
          echo "Build your project here"

      # 5. Run tests (Replace with your actual test commands)
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          # Replace this with your actual test commands, e.g., pytest, unittest
          echo "Run tests here"

      # 6. Deploy your project (Optional, adjust as per your deployment strategy)
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
